# CMS
CMS designed to manage blog posts, users, categories and tags

This was the capstone project of my studies at The Software Guild. 
It was a team (of 3) project where I designed the initial UI using Bootstrap and jQuery. The others added their own tweaks and
not to mention some easter eggs.

The rest of the functionality was divided between us as we worked together and individually. 

I've taken a copy of this project and have started to implement a Domain Layer. You can see this if you like at the organization
I created here on GitHub "TeachMeMoreCode".
